# .dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

This is a work in progress, trying to script everything by hand,
going from example to general expression doing everything

install.sh installs everything by
1. making a backup of your current dotfiles to archive
2. making a symbolic link in your home folder to dotfiles in this repo
