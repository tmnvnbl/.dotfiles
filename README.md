# .dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

This is a work in progress, trying to script everything by hand,
going from example to general expression for everything.
I will try to keep the install script as easy as possible,
with comments for explanation and examples


# Installation instructions
install.sh installs everything by
1. making a backup of your current dotfiles to archive
2. making a copy of each file in ./dotfiles to your home folder
